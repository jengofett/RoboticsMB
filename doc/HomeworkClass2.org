* Homework comments
  - You have just over a month to the competition.  
  - Don't wait until the last minute!
  - Yes, I expect you to get all the homework done before the next class.
  - No, do not work on homework during class.  That's why it's called "home" work.
  - If you're stuck for a long time, send me an email and be specific with
    any relevant error messages or behavior you're seeing.  You can commit
    changes to GitHub and sync so I can see your program.
  - Commit your changes to GitHub so you don't lose your work.
  - With GitHub, you can work on different computers as long as you
    commit your work and sync with GitHub.  Just make sure you install
    the necessary tools on the other computer following the instructions
    in the [[./RoboticsMB_Reference.org][Robotics MB Reference Guide]].
* Class 2 Exercises
  - Use the Sensor sketch we started in class. Save it under a different name.
  - Normalize the sensor readings so that if there is nothing in front
    of the sensor, the reading is close to zero.  Use separate
    normalization offset values for left, center, and right.
  - Write a function that prints out “Detect Left” when there is
    something on the left, “Detect Right” when there is something on
    the right, and “Detect Straight” if there is something straight
    ahead.
  - Write a function to control the motors to avoid obstacles if they
    come within a certain range.
  - Add the capability to use the IR remote to switch between
    autonomous and manual control.
* Robot Design
  1. In your Engineering Notebook, start sketching designs for the competition.
    Refer to the [[./2015RoboticsCompetition.html][Robotic Competition Rules]] and come up with approaches for:
     1) How to load/unload the payload
     2) How to carry the payload
     3) The logic required to navigate around a maze
        An example logic diagram is shown below.

  2. Program your robot to implement your maze navigation logic
     - Build your own maze and try to cover different maze "scenarios"
       such as:
       - Right turn
       - Left turn
       - "U" turn
       - Dead end

* Robotics Merit Badge Workbook
  By Class 3, make sure you have the following sections filled out:
  - 1a and b - Safety
  - Section 3 - General knowledge.  Discuss 3 of 5 major Robotic fields
  - Section 4 a and b.
    - Describe your approach to performing the competition tasks
    - Start writing down designs for your robot.
